# AuthentiCmd - 1.2.6 #

A command based application that extends AuthenticCmd has access to a very tidy
user input handler. AuthentiCmd allows the author to validate input as it
arrives and initiate a loop to collect user input and run services based on
these inputs.

Services are defined as operations that can accept command line arguments from
the user and execute a set of code on request.
